# WQU Capstone Project - Group 14
# Tactical Asset Allocation using Reinforcement Learning
This project aims to explore and compare different Tactical Asset Allocation models and then build a Tactical Asset Allocation model that can capture short/medium-term trends and inefficiencies in the market and allocate assets to the portfolio to maximize the risk adjusted returns. The objectives of this project consists of studying the existing Tactical Asset Allocation models, comparing the Tactical Asset Allocation models based on their performance and developing a Tactical Asset Allocation model based on Reinforcement Learning.


This repository contains code submission for capstone project course required for successful completeion of the MScFE course at WorldQuant University.
